# CRT-MP3-Player
been in position of a 4" Sony CRT Display for a few months and would like to see if i can make an 80s take on an iPod by utilizing the CRT and couple of other pieces of hardware from the time. the main driver of this project will be a raspberry pi zero for its compact size the rest i shall make up as i go along. Ideally id like to have this project to resemble the same build style from apple at the time with the macintosh plus as such I shall be using spares from that era to help me recreate the same feel with modern functionality like music streaming and bluetooth. my knowledge is Very limited as i know only basic coding, as part of my job i code a web app so i hope i can reinterpret my skills into something personal for myself. any help would be appreciated as I'm always open to suggestions!
